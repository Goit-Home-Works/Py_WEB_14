# Homework #14

In this task, we continue to refine our REST API application from home [task 13](https://github.com/Goit-Home-Works/Py_WEB_13).

## Assignment

1. Create documentation for your homework using Sphinx. To do this, add docstrings to the necessary functions and methods of classes.

2. Unit test your homework repository modules using the Unittest framework. Take as a basis the example from the note for the module `tests/test_unit_repository_notes.py`.

3. Functionally test any route of your choice from your homework using the pytest framework.

## Additional task

4. Cover your homework with tests more than 95%. Use the `pytest-cov' package to check.
